    "### 1. Central Brain Binary Mask (`JRC2018U_central_brain_mask.nrrd`)\n",
    "This is a simple binary mask of the central brain neuropile.\n",
    "- **Voxels inside** any central brain neuropile are assigned a value of **255**.\n",

    "This is a single image where each central brain neuropile is represented by a unique integer ID.\n",
    "- Each voxel's value corresponds to the ID of the neuropile it belongs to.\n",
    "- If neuropiles overlap, the voxel will be assigned the ID of the last neuropile processed in the loop.\n",

    "This CSV file is the key to understanding the `ROIs.nrrd` label mask. It connects the integer IDs in the mask back to their biological names.\n",

    "**How to use it:**\n",

    "3. Note its corresponding `ROI_number`.\n",
