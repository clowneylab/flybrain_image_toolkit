# Flybrain_image_toolkit

A collection of tools to process Drosophila brain images. Each folder below contains a separate tool with its own documentation.

## Tools

- [cellbody_detect](cellbody_detect/README.md): Tool for detecting and counting cell bodies in Drosophila brain images. Includes a Napari ROI editor for manual annotation and review.

- [CMTK_rigid](CMTK_rigid/README.md): Batch processing scripts for rigid registration of images using CMTK, optimized for the JRC2018U template.

- [CMTK_warp](CMTK_warp/README.md): Batch processing scripts for non-rigid (warp) registration of images using CMTK, also targeting the JRC2018U template.

Refer to each tool's README for usage instructions and details.
